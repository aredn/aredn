+Subject: [PATCH] skbuff: add DSA specific data to struct skb_shared_info
+
+All of the already existing DSA tagging protocol drivers
+are storing the tagging data directly into the skb. In most
+cases that is the only way to send the required information
+to the underlying ethernet switch.
+
+However on certain platforms (like the Qualcomm IPQ40xx
+SoCs) the built-in ethernet switch is connected directly
+to an ethernet MAC, and the tagging information must be
+sent out-of-band which is done directly via the hardware
+TX descriptors of the ethernet MAC.
+
+In such cases, putting the information into the skb causes
+unneccesary overhead, because the ethernet driver must
+remove that before sending the ethernet frame towards to
+the hardware.
+
+This change adds two new DSA specific fields to struct
+skb_shared_info which makes it possible to send the
+tagging information via skb->shinfo. With this approach,
+the twofold modifications of the skb data can be avoided.
