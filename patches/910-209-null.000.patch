+Subject: [PATCH] net: dsa: add Qualcomm IPQ4019 built-in switch support
+
+Qualcomm IPQ40xx SoC-s have a variant of QCA8337N switch built-in.
+
+It shares most of the stuff with its external counterpart, however it is
+modified for the SoC.
+Namely, it doesn't have second CPU port (Port 6), so it has 6 ports
+instead of 7.
+It also has no built-in PHY-s but rather requires external PSGMII based
+companion PHY-s (QCA8072 and QCA8075) for which it first needs to carry
+out calibration before using them.
+PSGMII has a SoC built-in PHY that is used to connect to the PHY-s which
+unfortunately requires some magic values as the datasheet doesnt document
+the bits that are being set or the register at all.
+
+Since its built-in it is MMIO like other peripherals and doesn't have its
+own MDIO bus but depends on the SoC provided one.
+
+CPU connection is at Port 0 and it uses some kind of a internal connection
+and no traditional RGMII/SGMII.
+It also doesn't use in-band tagging like other qca8k switches so a shinfo
+based tagger is used.
