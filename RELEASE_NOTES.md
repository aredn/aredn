# 3.23.12.0

## Enhancements

* Added Supernode support.

  "Supernodes" are specifically configured AREDN nodes in various locations which support a 
"mesh of meshes". With this release your localnode will automatically detect a nearby 
supernode, and will show a new button on the Mesh Status page, labeled "Cloud Mesh". 
Clicking on that button will take you to the Mesh Status page of that supernode and show you 
all the nodes and services on the Cloud Mesh. You can navigate to any of them as though they
were on your local mesh.

  The URL for the supernode map is currently https://arednmap.xojs.org/  Clicking on any of the 
nodes in the upper-right-hand corner of the map will filter all other nodes out, showing only the 
types selected.

* Remember and reinstall packages after firmware upgrade (AFTER this version is installed)
* Simplified search tool
* Added LZ77 decompression for Mikrotik firmware, which is now using a different compression method
* Cron
  * Now run cron.boot tasks earlier
  * Changed pollrate default to one hour
  * Added installable cron package for people who need more functionality
* Improved dual radio configuration support in hAPs
* Added support for wildcard DNS subdomains
* Now using frequency list for scan.  Some hardware didn’t scan all the frequencies we want by default. (Not a fix for the scan issue seen on some AC devices.)
* Set tunnel weight to 1 and provided UI to change it. With this change, if there are both RF and tunnel links to a destination, the tunnel value can be set high (relatively poor).  In that way traffic will only flow over the tunnel if the RF link goes down.  This provides an effective method for implementing backup links.
* Bumped the allowed Ubiquiti version numbers to support AREDN installation on newer LiteBeam 5ACs.  (Probably all new Ubiquiti devices but currently only tested on Litebeams).
* Xlink broadcast - Allow xlinks to broadcast OLSR traffic as well as targeting specific IPs.

## New device support

None in this release

## Bug fixes

* Now detect if we support firstboot mode (x86 VMs don't support it, so don't show the button in that case)
* Fixed dnsmasq directives 
* Correctly set wifi wan mode when depending on the mesh wifi setting.
* Corrected a bug where it would mess up the wan wifi when switching the band of the mesh wifi
* Made LQM neighbor improvements (fixed occasional exclusion of specific DtD neighbors)

## Known problems

* Ubiquiti 802.11ac devices - missing wifi scan and waterfall info

For a full list of supported products, see the list [here](http://downloads.arednmesh.org/snapshots/SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md).

**Notes:**

1. **Important** - the initial factory installation instructions for Ubiquiti 802.11 ac products are new.  They can be found in the AREDN Online Documentation [here](http://docs.arednmesh.org/en/latest/arednGettingStarted/installing_firmware.html#ubiquiti-802-11ac-first-install-process).

2. The 802.11ac products offer noticeable advantages over the legacy 802.11n devices.  If you’re contemplating a new deployment or just looking for better performance, consider an 802.11ac device.  Here’s [a list of recommended devices](https://www.arednmesh.org/content/device-migration-suggestions) for migrations.

3. Over and above neighbor status states of pending, active and idle, new states of hidden and exposed have been added. Because the nodes talk amongst themselves, your node knows which of its neighbor nodes are nearby but hidden from it. This can be useful for network management. Exposed nodes are nodes that a node can see, but will block it from transmitting to other neighbors when they are transmitting. It's a bit complex - see the 'exposed node problem' in Wikipedia for more detail The AREDN team hopes to use these parameters in the future to reduce channel congestion.

# 3.22.12.0

Since version 3.22.8.0 was released in August, over 50 nightly builds have been released. So the dev team decided that it was time for another production release. While many of them were small tweaks, some were significant. Here’s a summary:

## UI (web page) updates.

Many updates were made to the UI (web pages) to increase usability and provide additional information. Some highlights:
 
* Added NTP update period to basic setup page - can now choose between daily and hourly updates    
* Now display host totals rather than OLSR totals     
* Added search capabilities to the Mesh Status page     
* Grouped Mesh RF info if WiFi is enabled     
* Both types of gateways on Status page now displayed    
* Added a warning when attempting to add extra packages to 32 MB nodes

* Advertised services:
    * Determination logic updated
    * Added more 3XX redirects + 401 authentication
    * If redirect ends at an https link, assume it is valid

# 3.22.8.0

The AREDN development team has shifted into high gear with this third release of 2022!  This production release adds the many fixes and enhancements made since 3.22.6.0

## Fixes

* Dealt with LAN on AR300M always having the same MAC address.

# 3.22.6.0

AREDN production release 3.22.6.0 is now available.  This is the release you've been looking for :-)

Since the last production release, there have been 136 separate ‘pull requests’ in the AREDN github repository.   Those requests pulled these significant improvements and new features into the AREDN software:
1. The conversion from Perl programming to Lua is complete - the result is a significantly smaller, somewhat faster, code base.

2. Due to the recovered space in the image, tunnels are now always installed, so nothing needs to be done with them during future upgrades.

3. After this upgrade, future upgrades should be much more reliable, especially on low memory devices.

4. Tunnels will be prevented from accidentally connecting over the mesh.

    Tunnels normally connect via the WAN interface, that being the point of the things. However, if the WAN interface on a node goes down for some reason (the tunnel server/client Internet fails) the node will select a new way to talk to the Internet by first routing over the Mesh. When this happens, tunnels could end up being routed partially over the mesh, which is bad because tunnels are also part of the mesh. So, we now prevent this by default by adding a firewall rule.


5. You can now adjust the poll rate for alerts. AREDN alerts and local alerts (those yellow banner things you see sometimes) were polled twice a day. This is now configurable.

6. There is now a 60-second timeout when tunnel connections are interrupted. 

    Node tunnels run over TCP/IP so they guarantee that what is sent is what will be received. This is all fine when things are running reliably, but if a connected tunnel fails for a bit, but then recovers, this guarantee means very old, pending traffic will still be delivered. In AREDN’s case, this traffic is not useful to the user, and for OLSR it is positively dangerous to deliver ancient routing information. This is all low level protocol stuff and there will be no visible effects to users.


7. Nodes which are only connected via the WAN port and tunnels (no Wifi, no LAN) can cause some configuration problems because AREDN really wants either the LAN port to be connected or the WiFI to be enabled. We made some changes, so this is no longer a requirement. Thanks to K1KY, who has some unusual setups, for finding this.

8. Automatic NTP sync - we now locate an NTP server (either the one configured or by searching the mesh for a local one) and sync the time daily.

9. Added the ability to change the default VLAN for the WAN port. Currently not available on devices which contain network switches.

10. Included iperf3 by default, as well as a simple web UI. Its use is described here in the AREDN online docs.

11. Updated the Advanced Configuration page; sorted items on the page into categories.

12. Added the capability of loading firmware updates "locally" after copying them to the node via SCP.  This is useful if you’re trying to update a distant node over marginal links.   Information on how to use it is in the AREDN online docs, here.

13. Nodes will now drop nodenames and services that haven't been included in a broadcast for approximately 30 minutes.

14. The hardware brand and model have been added to the main page.

15. Messages banner will only be displayed on the Status & Mesh pages, keeping the setup & admin pages uncluttered.

16. Channels -3 and -4 have been added to 2 GHz, for use in those countries where it’s legal.

17. Added link quality management (LQM). It’s designed to make the AREDN network more stable and improve the available bandwidth.    

    When enabled LQM accomplishes this in two ways:
First, it drops links to neighbors which won't work well. Links are dropped that don't have good SNR, are too far away, or have low quality (forcing retransmissions).
Second, it uses the distance to the remaining links to optimize the radio which improves the bandwidth. This mechanism replaces the older ‘auto-distance’ system which was often confused by distant nodes with which it could barely communicate.


Many LQM parameters are capable of being modified to allow for local network circumstances.  There’s documentation on LQM in both the node help file and in the AREDN on-line docs.

**NOTE 1:** LQM is turned off by default, unless it was previously enabled in a nightly build.

**NOTE 2:** Latitude and longitude need to be configured in order for LQM to work properly.
 
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you’re running MeshChat and/or iPerfSpeed, after this upgrade you’ll need to install compatible versions of them (but note that with the built-in throughput test you may no longer need iPerfSpeed).  URLs for those versions:

iperfSpeed: https://github.com/kn6plv/iperfspeed/raw/master/iperfspeed_0.6-lua_all.ipk

MeshChat: https://github.com/kn6plv/meshchat/raw/master/meshchat_2.0_all.ipk

# 3.22.1.0

This release includes many significant improvements in the underlying OpenWRT code and stability/scalability fixes to the OLSR mesh routing protocol.
 
## List of Changes:
​
1. The AREDN  simplified firmware filename standard has been changed to the default OpenWRT convention to leverage data files created at build time for future automation of firmware selection.

    When installing this firmware release, from prior firmware versions, you may get an error message similar to

        “This filename is NOT appropriate for this device.“
        “This device expects a file such as: aredn-3.22.1.0-main-ef2d605-ubnt-nano-m-xw-.*sysupgrade.bin”
        “Click OK to continue if you are CERTAIN that the file is correct”

    Ensure that you are loading the correct file by referring to the downloads page, then safely ignore the warning.   Once this release is loaded, this error message will never occur again.

2. When the size of the hostname and service advertisements exceeded the size of a single network packet, only IP addresses would be known.  The advertised services and hostname would not propagate to other nodes on the network.  The OLSR routing protocol was changed to fix this.

3. The OLSR scalability failure, commonly called “OLSR storms”, has been fixed.  Large networks with hundreds of nodes would experience cycles of routing disruption, making the network unusable.  

4. SNR history may be missing neighbor node names – fixed.

5. When defining a local location of packages in Advanced Configuration, there was no way to change the location of some packages obtained from the upstream Freifunk group.    The Advanced Configuration page now has a row to define this local location.

6. Performance improvements were made to the Mesh Status page based on results from the large scale stress test on Oct 31, 2021.

7. Local alerts as configured on the Advanced Configuration page can now have zones which allow a mesh user to subscribe to alert messages affecting a specific locale.

8. The allowed number of tunnel connections is now configurable on the Advanced Configuration page.

9. There are numerous API updates.

# 3.20.3.0

The AREDN team is pleased to announce the general availability of the latest stable release of AREDN firmware. We now fully support 70+ devices from four manufacturers. This diversity of supported equipment enables hams to choose the right gear for a given situation and budget.

AREDN firmware is now based on the most recent stable version of OpenWRT19.07.2 which was released in March 2020. This improvement is significant in that it enables AREDN firmware to benefit from the many bug fixes, security improvements and feature enhancements provided by OpenWRT developers from around the world.

The latest AREDN firmware contains features inherited from the newest OpenWRT upstream release (19.07.2). One important change is the inclusion of a new target (architecture) for the firmware, labelled “ath79”, which is the successor to the existing “ar71xx” targets. OpenWRT explains that their main goal for this target is to bring the code into a form that will allow all devices to run a standard unpatched Linux kernel. This will greatly reduce the amount of customization required and will streamline the firmware development process. As not all supported devices have been migrated to the new “ath79” target, AREDN continues to build firmware for both targets.  You may notice that the AREDN download page has firmware for these two targets, and you should select the latest image based on the type of hardware (and the recommended target) on which it is to be installed.

## Key workarounds

### OLSR Restart

OLSR is the capability in AREDN that exchanges IP Addresses, Hostnames, and figures how to route packets across the mesh network.   There continues to be an intermittent defect when OLSR starts as a device is powering up. OLSR fails to propagate or may miss receiving some hostname information.  A one-time restart of OLSR will resolve the situation. This option can be found in Advanced Configuration settings--it doesn’t save a setting per se, rather restarts OLSR without rebooting the device.  

How do I know when OLSR needs to be restarted:

* IP Address is showing in Mesh Status:  go to the IP Address’s node and restart OLSR

* “Dtdlink” or “mid” is showing in a host name:  go to those hosts and restart OLSR

* Others can access a device by the hostname, but I can’t:  restart OLSR on my device

### PBE 400/400-ISO/620 degraded throughput over ethernet port

These Uniquiti PBE devices have a gigabit Ethernet port that does not handshake correctly with some switches.   The device’s Ethernet port is locked to a 100mbps rate at Full-Duplex (still sufficient for the max rates generally achieved over RF).  This made the port always functional, but for some switches the performance may be severely degraded. It is recommended to lock the rate on all switches this devices is connected to at the same 100mbps rate at Full-Duplex.  Check your switch’s port statistics to determine if there are TX or RX packet errors. Alternatively, an iperf test from the node to another node on the same switch will identify if there is any performance degradation.

### Upgrading Firmware Images

1) 32M RAM devices continue to be at the limit of available memory.  This means that doing a sysupgrade to load new firmware may take many tries to succeed.   Don't use these devices at hard to reach tower sites! The sysupgrade process needs close to 10M of memory to succeed. 

    **Tips to get it to work:**

    1) fresh reboot and very quickly do the upgrade (recommended for all devices, particular if at a tower site)

    2) disable mesh RF and any use of wireless, reboot before sysupgrade

    3) disable or uninstall any packages that are running, e.g. meshchat

    4) as an almost last resort, scp the .bin image to /tmp on the node and from the command line type "sysupgrade -n <.bin filename>" (does not save settings)

    5) as the last resort, tftp to load the factory image (does not save settings) 

2) Do not count on being able to sysupgrade to return back to older AREDN images, when upgrading to ‘ath79’ target images.    It might work, it might not based on if model names were cleaned up and changed moving to ath79. The older images may not be recognized on the newer target images.  Do a tftp process instead.

3) To know what image to use, pay close attention to the table located here (scroll down):  https://github.com/aredn/aredn_ar71xx .
